issue is in yoru other entries.

Kafka is an open source distributed streaming platform that belongs 
to the Apache Hadoop family. It is mainly used in data ingestion and 
building real time data pipelines. Since Kafka is fault tolerant, 
scalable and efficient it is in production today in thousands of 
companies. Kafka also works as messaging system based on the 
publisher-subscriber model where the publisher produces data and 
the subscriber consumes the data. It can be compared to ActiveMQ 
in the messaging space~\cite{hid-sp18-517-ApacheKafka}.


The two main real-time streaming applications of Kafka are: \\
1.Building data pipe-lines to transport data between systems of 
   applications.\\
2.building applications that transform or react to stream of data. \\

A few use cases of Kafka are website activity tracking, messaging 
and log aggregation~\cite{hid-sp18-517-ApacheKafka}.
